## Notes ##
It is recommended to install [Nginx](http://nginx.net/) by doing a full compile & build. Not all package repositories keep their branches updated. For security it is your duty to maintain a good working environment and thus includes all interfacing applications.

A great resource is the [Nginx Wiki](http://wiki.nginx.org/).

Run this command for defaults load nginx when system start
/usr/sbin/update-rc.d -f nginx defaults
